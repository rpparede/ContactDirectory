# ContactDirectory


This Application was created to Store the information of students interested in ESIS (Ecuadorian Students Innovating Solutions). 
This application lets team leads record the contact information about students and easily manage it instead of using Microsoft Excel which is not visually organized. 

C# (.NET) was used as the main programming language for this application and the data base design was created using MySQL.
